# Lightning Network Experiment

During the research period of Lightning Network implementation, we have created a test prototype for players and bankrollers. 
Smart-contract of our channels interacts only with test tokens(approve required).



## Player
Players interface allows to open channel and refresh the current channel status. 
In any moment player can save channelâ€™s status in blockchain and close it with both sides confirmation. 
After saving, channel status updates in blockchain, contract accepts the latest value.

## Bankroller
Bankroller automatically opens channel by players request and signs latest channel status.
